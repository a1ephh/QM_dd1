Quine-McCluskey Logic Minimization

Project by Arwa Hassan and Nadine Donia

Test cases:
1. all PIS are EPIs
2. some PIs are EPIs (need to check the remaining non-essential PIs)
3. no EPIs (so solution needs to be all from non-essential PIs)
4. high number of variables & maxterm (checking core functionality and testing its limits)
5. out of bounds error checking to verify error catching works
